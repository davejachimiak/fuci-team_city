".fuci-team_city.rb" in your project's root directory. You should create
that file and configure fuci-team_city there. The configuration must
include your TeamCity username and password. **Therefore, you should
include ./.fuci-team_city.rb in .gitignore.**

Fuci::TeamCity.configure do |fu|
  fu.host     = 'http://nest.icisapp.com:8111/'
  fu.username = '<user name>'
